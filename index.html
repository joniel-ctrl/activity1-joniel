        Verse 1
        Dashing through the snow
        In a one-horse open sleigh
        O'er the fields we go
        Laughing all the way
        Bells on bobtails ring
        Making spirits bright
        What fun it is to ride and sing
        A sleighing song tonight
        Chorus
        Jingle bells, jingle bells: Jingle all the way, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
        Jingle bells, jingle bells: Jingle all the way, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
        Verse 2
        A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride
        Miss Fanny Bright was seated by my side
        The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot
        Got into a drifted bank and then we got upsot

        Chorus
        Hey, jingle bells, jingle bells: Jingle all the way, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
        Jingle bells, jingle bells: Jingle all the way, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
